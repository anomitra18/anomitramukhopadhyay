Welcome to my github repository, I am Anomitra Mukhopadhyay, I am an Indian student who has pursued a Master's degree in Robotics from Cranfield University, United Kingdom, which is one of the top recognised universities across the globe. I have also pursued a Bachelor of Technology degree in Mechatronics Engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India, which is one of the top recognised universities in India. 

I am enthusiastic about the development of robotic technology in current times with particular focus on industrial robots, which became the reason behind my pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering and a Master's degree in Robotics. I have obtained practical experience in robotic, electronic systems, simulations and CAD software and potentially carried out research projects in the field of industrial robots. I am a effective communicator with professional efficiency in English. I am Competent in robotics and carrying forward the work and research of potentially developing robots. My Proven strengths include strong work ethic, problem-solving skills and the ability to deliver results on time.

I have never been employed before, that’s the reason behind me not having any work experience, yet I have extensive hands-on industrial technical knowledge and experience that I have gained through different projects in the field of Robotics and Mechatronics both in terms of software and hardware during my 5 years of academic tenure. This repositiory contains my proven technical ability in the field of robotics with the help of these three important academic projects, apart from other small projects that I have done in my 5 years of academic tenure (bachelors and masters degree).

The project that was undertaken by me during my Bachelor's degree was: Design and Development of Mobile Manipulator for Warehouse Application’. The project focuses on developing an autonomous mobile robot with a manipulator performing pick and place operations in warehouses or sorting centres.

The group project that was undertaken be me during my Master's degree was: ‘Robot Room Service’. The project aims to develop a reliable method for service robots to perform room service jobs in a hotel environment.

The Individual project that was undertaken by me during my Master's degree was: Hybrid-Framework for Multi-Robot Collision Avoidance’. The thesis aims to identify how robot path planning and obstacle avoidance in a dynamic environment could be made much more optimised and promising using the combination of Machine Learning with already available traditional approaches.

I wish to learn and develop my technical knowledge and also gain work experience by working on different client based projects. I am confident about my work, I am a person who believes in hard work, smart work, patience and perseverance. You are more than welcome to take your time looking at these projects and analysing my practical efficiency. I will more than happy to provide furthur in depth details of the projects in the future.

Thank You.
